The idea is to use phototransitor, led light, capacitors and servo motor to control the opening and closing of the door.
using light intensity, when the value gooes above 99, the light in the house comes on notifying the owner about somebody is at the door. 
it gives a lapse of 1 minute the the owner recieves a messages to turn own the potentiometer that powers the servo motor to open the door.
if the potentiomenter is not turned the message is displayed at the door notifying the person closed bye.
but if it is turned the door opens and as he gets in the light goes off and the sensor returns to its running state.
